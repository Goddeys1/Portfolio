                <h3>Emerging Trends in AI-Driven Security</h3>
                <p>
                    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the cybersecurity landscape, offering innovative solutions to combat increasingly sophisticated cyber threats. 
                    By leveraging AI-driven tools, organizations can predict, detect, and respond to threats faster and more effectively than ever before.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Predictive Threat Detection:</strong> AI-powered systems analyze vast datasets in real-time to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. 
                    Machine learning models predict attack patterns, enabling proactive defense strategies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Automated Incident Response:</strong> Security operations centers (SOCs) use AI to automate responses to threats. AI systems can isolate compromised networks, neutralize malware, 
                    and restore operations quickly, reducing downtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>AI-Enhanced Anomaly Detection:</strong> Monitoring network traffic and user behavior, AI detects deviations from normal activity patterns, which may indicate unauthorized access or malware infiltration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These advancements are shaping industries such as healthcare, finance, retail, and government by offering practical applications like fraud detection, data protection, and cyber espionage prevention.
