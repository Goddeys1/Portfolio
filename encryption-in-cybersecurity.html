                <h3>The Role of Encryption in Modern Cybersecurity</h3>
                <p>
                    Encryption is the cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, ensuring that sensitive data remains secure during storage and transmission. 
                    By converting readable data into an unreadable format, encryption protects information from unauthorized access and cyber threats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Key Benefits of Encryption:</strong>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Confidentiality:</strong> Encryption ensures that only authorized parties can access sensitive information, safeguarding personal data, financial transactions, and corporate secrets.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Encryption prevents unauthorized modifications to data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Compliance with Regulations:</strong> Encryption helps organizations meet legal requirements such as GDPR and CCPA, protecting user privacy and avoiding penalties.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Encryption is widely used in various applications, including secure communications, cloud storage, and database protection. 
                    Technologies like <strong>Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</strong> and <strong>RSA</strong> are commonly employed to secure sensitive data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As cyber threats evolve, encryption remains a critical tool in defending against data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other malicious activities.
